# River-crossing-pygame
This was a project which I had undertaken as a course project for the iSS(Intro to Software Systems) course at my college IIIT-H.
This game is python based and very easy to understand. I will soon add a set of instructions on how to run my game :)
If someone wants to ask me anything regarding this, the you can create an issue under this repo. Hope you like my game.
